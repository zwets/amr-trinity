# This TSV file specifies the list of inputs for a hAMRonization workflow run.
# Its first line (ex. comment lines and empty lines) must have column headings,
# and must define at least the columns listed below. Columns may be in any order.
#
# Every row must have a (possibly empty) value in every column.  The 'biosample'
# column must have a unique non-empty value in every row.  If you omit assembly,
# reads, or species, then tools that require these inputs will not run.

species	biosample	assembly	read1	read2
